\section{Within-host model}
Inference for the within-host model consists of finding the mode of the posterior distribution (i.e., the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate) and using a Laplace approximation.
The approximation is primarily used to compute the distribution of the $R_0$ ratio.
\subsection{Data}
In the \verb=d197n.xlsx= file there are four sheets: the first three describing experimental observations and the fourth error codes and units.
The \verb=PYRO= sheet is particularly important.
The values in the \verb=PYRO= sheet are given as percentages, not proportions.
The percentage indicates the percentage of the variant type.
For example, in the measurement on day 2, the ferret \verb=0W100VDon-F1= has a value of 98.5.
Negative values are reserved for error codes.
